# STM32F072 Firmware Template

A modern firmware template for STM32 microcontrollers focused on:

- Modular architecture
- Hardware abstraction
- Host-based testing
- Static analysis
- Security checks
- CI/CD automation

---

## Purpose

This project provides a solid foundation for developing reliable and maintainable STM32 firmware.

Main objectives:

- Separate application logic from hardware
- Improve testability
- Reduce coupling
- Support long-term scalability
- Integrate modern development workflows

---

## Tools

VSCode main extensions:

- C/C++
- CMake Tools
- Cortex-Debug
- GitHub Actions
- SARIF Viewer

---

## Architecture

Layered architecture:

```text
app
 ↓
services
 ↓
core
 ↓
drivers
 ↓
platform (STM32F072)
```

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for details.

```

---

## Build Firmware

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

Generated files:

```text
firmware.elf
firmware.bin
firmware.hex
firmware.map
```

---

## Run Tests

```bash
cmake -B build/tests \
    -DANALYSIS=ON \
    -DTESTS=ON

cmake --build build/tests

ctest --test-dir build/tests
```

Tests execute on the host using GoogleTest.

---

## Static Analysis

### clang-format

```bash
./scripts/clang-format.sh
```

### clang-tidy

```bash
./scripts/clang-tidy.sh
```

### cppcheck

```bash
./scripts/cppcheck.sh
```

### CodeQL

```bash
./scripts/codeql.sh
```

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions automatically performs:

### Analysis

- clang-format validation
- clang-tidy
- cppcheck
- unit tests
- ASAN
- UBSAN

### Firmware

- ARM cross compilation
- ELF generation
- BIN generation
- HEX generation

### Security

- CodeQL analysis
- SARIF reporting

---

## Design Principles

- Separation of concerns
- Hardware abstraction
- Testability first
- Dependency minimization
- Reproducible builds
- CI-driven quality control
